abstract = {In this paper they create a model to explain location of check-ins in GoWall, BrightKite and Cell phone data. They create a spatial temporal model that uses mixture model to learn the density of the tweets. In the mixture model there are two components, one for work and one for home. The probability of belonging to each of the components is govern by time and then the location is govern by the spatial model learned. To add on top of that, this paper introduces a social explanation for check-ins that are not corralated with the two components. The idea is that if an individual is checking - in not according to the two components then there are social ties that explains that. To show results they compute both log-likelihood and also predictions experiments.},

@article{Ahn2011,
abstract = {Over the past several years, social networking sites have arisen to facilitate social interactions on the Internet while revolutionizing how online users interact with others. Most social networking sites offer the basic features of online interaction, communication, and interest sharing, letting individuals create online profiles that other users can view. Unfortunately, current trends in social networks indirectly require users to become system and policy administrators to protect their online contents. Social networks' security and privacy requirements still aren't well understood or fully defined. Nevertheless, it's clear that they'll be quite different from classic security and privacy requirements because social networks involve user-centric concerns and allow multiple users to specify security policies on shared data. So, we must bring a depth of security experience from multiple security domains and technologies to this field, as well as a breadth of knowledge about social networks.},

@article{Kivela2014,
abstract = {In most natural and engineered systems, a set of entities interact with each other in complicated patterns that can encompass multiple types of relationships, change in time and include other types of complications. Such systems include multiple subsystems and layers of connectivity, and it is important to take such ‘multilayer' features into account to try to improve our understanding of complex systems. Consequently, it is necessary to generalize ‘traditional' network theory by developing (and validating) a framework and associated tools to study multilayer systems in a comprehensive fashion. The origins of such efforts date back several decades and arose in multiple disciplines, and now the study of multilayer networks has become one of the most important directions in network science. In this paper, we discuss the history of multilayer networks (and related concepts) and review the exploding body of work on such networks. To unify the disparate terminology in the large body of recent work, we discuss a general framework for multilayer networks, construct a dictionary of terminology to relate the numerous existing concepts to each other and provide a thorough discussion that compares, contrasts and translates between related notions such as multilayer networks, multiplex networks, interdependent networks, networks of networks and many others. We also survey and discuss existing data sets that can be represented as multilayer networks. We review attempts to generalize single-layer-network diagnostics to multilayer networks. We also discuss the rapidly expanding research on multilayer-network models and notions like community structure, connected components, tensor decompositions and various types of dynamical processes on multilayer networks. We conclude with a summary and an outlook.},

abstract = {It is well known that different types of social ties have essentially different influence on people. However, users in online social networks rarely categorize their contacts into "family", "colleagues", or "classmates". While a bulk of research has focused on inferring particular types of relationships in a specific social network, few publications systematically study the generalization of the problem of inferring social ties over multiple heterogeneous networks. In this work, we develop a framework for classifying the type of social relationships by learning across heterogeneous networks. The framework incorporates social theories into a factor graph model, which effectively improves the accuracy of inferring the type of social relationships in a target network by borrowing knowledge from a different source network. Our empirical study on five different genres of networks validates the effectiveness of the proposed framework. For example, by leveraging information from a coauthor network with labeled advisor-advisee relationships, the proposed framework is able to obtain an F1-score of 90{\%} (8-28{\%} improvements over alternative methods) for inferring manager-subordinate relationships in an enterprise email network.},

@article{Crandall2010,
abstract = {We investigate the extent to which social ties between people can be inferred from co-occurrence in time and space: Given that two people have been in approximately the same geographic locale at approximately the same time, on multiple occasions, how likely are they to know each other? Furthermore, how does this likelihood depend on the spatial and temporal proximity of the co-occurrences? Such issues arise in data originating in both online and offline domains as well as settings that capture interfaces between online and offline behavior. Here we develop a framework for quantifying the answers to such questions, and we apply this framework to publicly available data from a social media site, finding that even a very small number of co-occurrences can result in a high empirical likelihood of a social tie. We then present probabilistic models showing how such large probabilities can arise from a natural model of proximity and co-occurrence in the presence of social ties. In addition to providing a method for establishing some of the first quantifiable estimates of these measures, our findings have potential privacy implications, particularly for the ways in which social structures can be inferred from public online records that capture individuals' physical locations over time.},

abstract = {Operators of online social networks are increasingly sharing potentially sensitive information about users and their relationships with advertisers, application developers, and data-mining researchers. Privacy is typically protected by anonymization, i.e., removing names, addresses, etc.We present a framework for analyzing privacy and anonymity in social networks and develop a new re-identification algorithm targeting anonymized social-network graphs. To demonstrate its effectiveness on real-world networks, we show that a third of the users who can be verified to have accounts on both Twitter, a popular microblogging service, and Flickr, an online photo-sharing site, can be re-identified in the anonymous Twitter graph with only a 12{\%} error rate.Our de-anonymization algorithm is based purely on the network topology, does not require creation of a large number of dummy "sybil" nodes, is robust to noise and all existing defenses, and works even when the overlap between the target network and the adversary's auxiliary information is small.},

abstract = {Link prediction systems have been largely adopted to recommend new friends in online social networks using data about social interactions. With the soaring adoption of location--based social services it becomes possible to take advantage of an additional source of information: the places people visit. $\backslash$nIn this paper we study the problem of designing a link prediction system for online location--based social networks. We have gathered extensive data about one of these services, Gowalla, with periodic snapshots to capture its temporal evolution. We study the link prediction space, finding that about 30{\%} of new links are added among "place--friends", i.e., among users who visit the same places. We show how this prediction space can be made 15 times smaller, while still 66{\%} of future connections can be discovered. Thus, we define new prediction features based on the properties of the places visited by users which are able to discriminate potential future links among them.$\backslash$nBuilding on these findings, we describe a supervised learning framework which exploits these prediction features to predict new links among friends--of--friends and place--friends. Our evaluation shows how the inclusion of information about places and related user activity offers high link prediction performance. These results open new directions for real--world link recommendation systems on location--based social networks.},

@article{Wang2011,
abstract = {Our understanding of how individual mobility patterns shape and impact the social network is limited, but is essential for a deeper understanding of network dynamics and evo- lution. This question is largely unexplored, partly due to the difficulty in obtaining large-scale society-wide data that simultaneously capture the dynamical information on indi- vidual movements and social interactions. Here we address this challenge for the first time by tracking the trajecto- ries and communication records of 6 Million mobile phone users. We find that the similarity between two individuals' movements strongly correlates with their proximity in the social network. We further investigate how the predictive power hidden in such correlations can be exploited to ad- dress a challenging problem: which new links will develop in a social network. We show that mobility measures alone yield surprising predictive power, comparable to traditional network-based measures. Furthermore, the prediction accu- racy can be significantly improved by learning a supervised classifier based on combined mobility and network measures. We believe our findings on the interplay of mobility patterns and social ties offer new perspectives on not only link pre- diction but also network dynamics. Categories and Subject Desc},
